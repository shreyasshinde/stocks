How the Free Yahoo Finance API Works
Yahoo finance provides a great and simple way to download free stock quotes. This service returns stock data in a CSV. (comma delimited format, you can just open it in Excel if you like)
The service Yahoo finance provides for free stock quotes is REST based. (love REST based stuff) So all you need to do is assemble the URL you want and it will give you the data your looking for.
The API lets you specify multiple symbols to download with a maximum of 200 per call. (You can make multiple calls, but if you call too fast it will lock your IP so be warned)

How to call the free Yahoo Finance API
The base url your going to call is http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv
Then you add a ?s= and the stock symbols your interested in such as APPL, GOOG and MSFT like so
http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=AAPL+GOOG+MSFT
Then you specify the info you want. There is a large list of stuff you can specify, just look at the list below for more info.
http://finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?s=AAPL+GOOG+MSFT&f=nab
This will get the name of the stock, the ask price and bid price (the “nab” = name,ask and bid)
